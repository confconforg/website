ConfConf is a free conference for organisers of conferences around free and open source software and hardware.

The first edition, ConfConf 0, will take place in Sofia (Bulgaria) on June 14th and 15th 2025.

The idea is simple: a free, unconference-style gathering where we share experiences, challenges, and ideas about organizing FOSS events. We know a lot of us are struggling with the same challenges, and we hope that by getting together, we can all learn from another.

## Joining

Please join us on [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#confconf:matrix.org)!

As the conference is aimed at conference organisers, tickets are available by invitation only. If you would like to attend but didn't receive an invitation, please get in touch!

## Program

The event will be kickstarted with an opening keynote, and each day will be wrapped up with a summary session — but beyond that, the content will come from the participants. We will be around to facilitate discussions or assist in other ways if needed.

As a starting point, we have identified the following topics:

  * Shaping the Program:  How do you choose content? Do you set themes or let them emerge? How do you keep talks relevant and community-driven? Do you scout speakers or wait for them to come to you?
  * Growing Your Audience – How do you attract speakers and attendees? How do you reach underrepresented groups? What’s the best way to manage volunteers and enforce a code of conduct?
  * Funding & Ethics – How do you raise money through donations, sponsorships, or merch—while keeping things transparent and ethical? How much say should sponsors have?
  * Tech & Logistics – What infrastructure do you need? Which tools are you using? How do you handle video, streaming, networking, and making sure everything runs smoothly on-site?

## Accommodation

We have negotiated preferential rates at [Hemus Hotel](https://www.hemushotels.com/). Details will be announced shortly.
