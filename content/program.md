ConfConf uses the *[unconference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference)* format, where participants provide most of the content themselves and there is only a minimal programme.


To help kickstart the event, we'll make sure there is a opening keynote, and a summary *wrap-up* session each day — but beyond that, the content will come from the participants. The team will be around to facilitate discussions or assist in other ways if needed.

As a starting point, some topics which might be interesting to have a discussion on:

  * Shaping the Program:  How do you choose content? Do you set themes or let them emerge? How do you keep talks relevant and community-driven? Do you scout speakers or wait for them to come to you?
  * Growing Your Audience – How do you attract speakers and attendees? How do you reach underrepresented groups? What’s the best way to manage volunteers and enforce a code of conduct?
  * Funding & Ethics – How do you raise money through donations, sponsorships, or merch—while keeping things transparent and ethical? How much say should sponsors have?
  * Tech & Logistics – What infrastructure do you need? Which tools are you using? How do you handle video, streaming, networking, and making sure everything runs smoothly on-site?

However, don't let this limit you! Any topic can be interesting, and as long as it fits with our *Conference for Conference Organisers* theme, it is welcome!
