ConfConf is a free conference for organisers of conferences around free and open source software and hardware.

The first edition, ConfConf 0, will take place in Sofia (Bulgaria) on June 14th and 15th 2025.

The idea is simple: a free, unconference-style gathering where we share experiences, challenges, and ideas about organizing FOSS events. We know a lot of us are struggling with the same challenges, and we hope that by getting together, we can all learn from another.

## Joining

Please join us on [matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#confconf:matrix.org)!

As the conference is aimed at conference organisers, tickets are available by invitation only. If you would like to attend but didn't receive an invitation, please get in touch!


## Funding

The first edition is funded by [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org). Attendance for invited organisations is free, as well as catering throughout the event. [Donations](https://fosdem.org/support/donate/) to support the event are welcome!

The organisers hope that future editions will be co-organised by multiple organisations, if you are interested, talk to us during the event!
