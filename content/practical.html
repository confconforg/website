<h2>Accommodation</h2>

<p>
    We have negotiated preferential rates at <a href="https://www.hemushotels.com/">Hemus Hotel</a>. Thanks to sponsorship, the ticket is free. To keep the venue at the current rate, we do need to meet a minimum number of hotel bookings. So please hold off on arranging accommodation — we’ll let you know how and when to book soon.
